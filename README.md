# Retail Recommender System

This project implements a personalized product recommender system for a retail environment using customer transaction data. The goal is to enhance customer experience and drive sales through intelligent product suggestions.

## Problem Statement

Retail businesses often face challenges in improving customer engagement and increasing average order value. A recommender system can address these challenges by suggesting relevant products based on historical behavior and preferences.

## Approach

- **Data Preparation**: Loaded and preprocessed transaction data stored in a serialized format (`retail.pkl`).
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Analyzed customer purchasing patterns, frequency, and recency to understand behavior.
- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - Implemented collaborative filtering techniques using user-item interactions
  - Applied cosine similarity for item-based recommendations
  - Evaluated model precision and diversity

## Solution

The system provides top-N product recommendations for each customer based on their historical purchases and similar user behaviors. It supports better targeting in marketing campaigns and personalized promotions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Learnings

- Collaborative filtering models require careful handling of sparsity
- Preprocessing and scaling significantly impact model performance
- Personalization improves engagement but may require continuous retraining

## Future Work

- Integrate content-based filtering for hybrid recommendations
- Incorporate time-decay factors and seasonality
- Build a real-time recommendation engine with API support
